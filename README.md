## Section 02 - Dr. Denise Case/10 am

Hello everyone! I'm Annie Samapitha Chandolu, Annie for short. This is my first semester of Masters in Applied Computer Science, and I am looking forward to learning together with you all. 

My introduction goes something like this: "Born in Hyderabad, India, brought up in Abu Dhabi, U.A.E., completed my undergrad: B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology Rourkela, India. Did a summer course in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, and pursuing Masters in NWMSU, U.S.A!" 

Mostly, my interests lie in animation, music, art, and architecture. As for hobbies; I like to sing, draw, play badminton, swim when it is not freezing, chess, and baking when cakes don't burn. I can pick up languages pretty easily which is a boon and a bane as I tend to mix them up when speaking. I have a good sense of cultural appreciation and am always ready to learn more.

My major projects in UG were based on C++ and Python; so, it is exciting for me to learn Java. Hopefully, by the end of this semester, I will get used to the industrial environment and find solutions for overpopulation by introducing smarter alternate living methods using machine learning and big data analysis that are eco-friendly and economical. 

Let's have a great session ahead!
